# Midterm Examination

## Instructions

Please see the document ```QMB3311_midterm_exam.pdf``` in this folder.
Instructions for submission of the relevant website URL are included in the document
(and are part of the content of the course)
but the link is not necessary if you save your submission
in your repo in a folder called ```midterm_exam```.

### I will push the exam paper to this location at 4:30 EDT.
### Open this Webpage and refresh at 4:30 EDT to begin immediately.

The exam question paper has the following instructions:

"Follow the function design recipe to define functions for all of the following Exercises. 
For each function, create three examples to test your functions. 
Record the definitions in the Python scripts as described in Question 1 [similar to Assignment 5]. 
 

"Under time constraints, the emphasis is on creating function definitions 
and testing with examples. 
You are not responsible for error handling and can assume that the user will 
follow the preconditions and type contract.

*"Most importantly, take any shortcut you can, using the code from 
the course repository and any solutions from your previous assignments. 
The first step is often to locate a similar function and copy it to your module.
Then you can begin to either re-purpose that code or call the function in a new function,
to save yourself some time."*


## Guidelines


### Q: What will be the format of the midterm?

A: The midterm will be similar to Assignment 5. You will create or revise modules with several functions. 
Your script should run without error and the test cases in your examples should work correctly.




### Q: How do we submit the exam?

A: Submit the exam the same as you would for an assignment: push it to your GitHub repository by the end of the exam. According to the schedule, the class runs from 4:30 to 5:45 but I will accept submissions up to 5:55, to allow time to organize your files.




### Q: How can we reach you if we have questions during the exam?

A: I will be in the classroom the entire time.




### Q: Are we allowed to use online sources during our midterm? Are we allowed to look back at our old assignments and your GitHub during the midterm?

A: Yes, you may use any online material during the exam. As this is a course in computer programming, you will use the tools one normally has available to write software, including-and especially-any course materials on GitHub.
The only exception is that *you may not communicate to each other during the exam*.


### Good luck!
